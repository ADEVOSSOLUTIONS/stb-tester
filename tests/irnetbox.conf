Device ABC

Signal data as IRNetBox data blocks stored as ASCII Hex (e.g. FF -> a single byte of value 255).

Note: The data is of the form <signal name> MOD_SIG <max_num_lengths> <byte_array_in_ascii_hex>.
      For the data array to be correct on download, the MaxNumLengths parameter must
      be set to the same value as that used for generation of these data blocks, so
      before signal download, please set MaxNumLengths to the value preceding the data array.

      Where signals are 'Double Signals' or contain toggle bits, two blocks of data are
      generated, and labelled as 'signal1' and 'signal2'. The format of these lines is:
      <signal name> DMOD_SIG signal1|2 <max_num_lengths> <byte_array_in_ascii_hex>.
